Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis financial is a large financial advising corporation. Artemis financial required up to date and state of the art software security advice and work. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Software security adds a sense of trust between users and the software owner, while I believe that I was open and descriptive with different software issues the company faced. Coding securely prevents later security issues, such as hacks and data breaches. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Working within eclipse proved difficult, as the program presented challenges opening class files and code bases. These issues typically took several hours to resolve. Apart from that, coding and learning the more advanced ciphers/ best practice for secure coding was challenging as well. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Using checksum verification and maven dependency checker to assure that various plugins posed no risk. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Maven dependency checker assured that no new risks were introduced, while running the refactored and changed code insured the code was still functional.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Maven was challenging to understand, and I believe it will  come in handy later now that i understand how to operate it. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
My first project, linked in this repository, is definitely a good showing of understanding and implementing the skills required for it.
